Naruhodo is a python library for generating dependency-graph(DG) and knowledge-graph(KG) in networkx format from Japanese text or urls that contains Japanese texts. You can visualize these graphs directly in jupyter notebook or export graphs to JSON file for visualization using external programs.

### Dependency graph (DG)

[Dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) is a class of modern syntactic theories that are all based on the dependency relation (as opposed to the constituency relation) and that can be traced back primarily to the work of Lucien Tesnière. Dependency is the notion that linguistic units, e.g. words, are connected to each other by directed links.

[Dependency parsing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/14.pdf) is the analysis of dependency grammar on a block of text using computer programs. 
The directed linking nature of dependency grammar makes the result of dependency parsing directed graphs.

Naruhodo generates denpendency graphs(DG) directly from the output of dependency parsing programs. Below is an example of DG generated by naruhodo using the following texts.

```
"一郎は二郎が描いた絵を三郎に贈った。"
"三郎はこの絵を持って市場に行った。"
"市場には人が一杯だ。"
```

### Knowledge graph(KG)

Unlike DG, knowledge-graph(KG) tries to capture the meaningful relationship between different entities. KG is also generated from the output of dependency parsing programs, but the generation follows a different logic.

The methods available to KG is almost identical to those of DG.

Below is an example of KG generated by naruhodo using the following texts.

```
"一郎は二郎が描いた絵を三郎に贈った。"
"三郎はこの絵を持って市場に行った。"
"市場には人が一杯だ。"
```

## Installation

You can install the library directly from github using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/superkerokero/naruhodo.git
```

Naruhodo relies on external programs to do Japanese word and dependency parsing, so you need to have corresponding programs installed as well.

Naruhodo is designed to support multiple backend parsers, but currently only the support for `mecab` + `cabocha` is implemented.

For guide on installing `mecab` and `cabocha`, please refer to this page:

Support for other parsers such as `KNP` is planned in the future.

## Tutorial

The tutorial of naruhodo is provided as a `ipynb` file in the root folder. You can view it directly in your browser. This tutorial covers all the main functionalities of naruhodo.
